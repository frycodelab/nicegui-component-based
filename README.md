# Component based NiceGUI template 

This is a template based on NiceGUI, a fully python based framwork for web/native development. Yout can use plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript or components from the NiceGUI libary itself - they are mostly build with Quasar.

Goal of this template is to modularize the way a project is set up/ worked on.
The main aim is to make it easy for beginners/or advanced developers to start off relatively fast.
